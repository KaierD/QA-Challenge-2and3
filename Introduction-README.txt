Dear Manager,

For the part 2 of the challenge, I would recommand you open the Unity project using Unity 2020.3.16f1c1 version which is the version of Unity I used to do the challenge. Simply open the project, then go the the main scene and hit the 'Play' buttion. You will see there are 5 lifes and 4 missions activated for the gameplay.

For the part 3, the PDF file is in the folder called 'QAChallenge-Part3'.


Thank you for your patience,

Kyle Dong
